# Statistical	Efficacy of Distance Matrix	Anonymization
Project implementing distance matrix anonymization into regression methods, specifically answering the question: "Is	geographically	weighted	regression		
(GWR)	robust	to	using	the	Lipschitz	embedded	distance	matrix?"

The code is available in the analysis supplement, `DSI_Supp.html`, with the final report available as a PDF in `FinalReport.pdf` and poster presentation available in the `GWR_Lipschitz_Poster_CRH.pdf`. Presented at the Vanderbilt Data Science Institute Symposium, April 2019.
